      I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
      holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
      Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit. <br /><br />
      If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween
      pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep
      you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
